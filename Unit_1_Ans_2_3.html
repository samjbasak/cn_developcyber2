                The effect on the computer system is to slow down and even grind to a halt.
                The result is short-term or long-term outage. Companies lose a significant amount of revenue and are
                subject to blackmail.
                Companies often make decisions that make business sense and usually end up paying ransom because time is
                money,
                customers get annoyed with poor service and there is a danger that customers will leave and go to
                competitors.

                <li class="listindent1"> VIRUSES and CROSS PLATFORM MALWARE. </li>
                Employees that are not trained in recognising cyber threats act irresponsibly by opening personal emails
                and
                clicking on links and downloading free software on company assets which allows the malware to take root
                and
                spread through the computer network of a company.
                The links install the payloads to infect including the unzipping and extracting java jar files
                that have code used to compromise the host systems.
                Hackers can then get to the sensitive data and even monitor keystrokes entered, the camera and also the
                audio for
                targeted computers for exploitation.
                Sometimes the hack is not even known until it is too late.

                <li class="listindent1"> PHISHING. </li>
                Usually new, gullible or over helpful employees are tricked into divulging passwords or carrying out
                actions that allow malicious code
                to take root in the computer network.
                The practice of using personal emails in the company, personal browsing during breaks and work and
                clicking on links
                that install viruses and malware to take root. Companies find out once they are subject to ransom
                demands or start to notice losses.
                <p></p>
                Phishing is a method of a social engineering with the goal of obtaining sensitive data such as
                passwords, usernames, credit card numbers.
                The attacks often come in the form of instant messages or phishing emails designed to appear legitimate.
                The recipient of the email is then tricked into opening a malicious link, which leads to the
                installation of malware on the recipient’s computer. It can also obtain personal information by sending
                an email that appears to be sent from a bank, asking to verify your identity by giving away your private
                information.
                Uncovering phishing domains can be done easily with Security Trails.

        <li class="listindent1"> SQL INJECTION. </li>
        Poorly designed code enables the loop holes to be exploited by injecting unauthorised queries and gain access to
        sensitive data.
        More of a design issue rather than the user’s mistake.
