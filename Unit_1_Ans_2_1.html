                in some cases, money is also a motive but secondary motive.
                The activist perceives a company engaged in activities that goes against his values as fair targets.
                e.g. maybe abortion. He just wishes to cause outage of service or disruption to the company's
                Information Systems.
                At the most, he will delete data, research and may even steal employee HR data to identify staff.
                In some cases, they will demand money as they need it to finance their protest activities but this is
                generally a secondary motive.</li>

                <li class="listindent1"> WHO? and THE THREAT : THE INSIDER - DATA BREACHES. </li>

                He will use his insider knowledge to cause data breaches and divulge company information
                or even sell client's personal and financial data on the dark web. He may add, modify or delete data
                held on the computer system.
                He may even install viruses and malware to cause maxium cost to the company to put right.
                In the process, if he can make money then it is fair game to him.</li>

                <li class="listindent1"> WHO? and THE THREAT : THE PROFESSIONAL - VIRUSES, MALWARE and RANSOMEWARE.
                </li>
                MOTIVATION : Motivation of the Professional is pure greed and money oriented.
                Small to medium sized companies for them are easy to hack due to their size and likelihood of poor
                security protection.
                The purpose is to hack into systems to steal bank credit cards details from customer database and
                transactions.
                These stolen data can be used to make fraudulently transactions or steal identities and even sell these
                data on the dark web.
                In some some cases to blackmail the employees of interest or the company as a whole and extort money.
