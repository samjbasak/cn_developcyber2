                Companies suffer from loss of revenue due to service outage, bad publicity and loss of customer faith
                and

                Personal details stolen can be used against people to blackmail them so they suffer from anxiety and
                depression of what can happen to them, who knows what and how much is a constant fear.
                People lose trusting computer systems or giving out their personal data even when it is needed to get
                some services.
                Some people are extremely weary of opening any form of email attachments or lose the faith to download
                any application for fear of being a virus infecting their computers.

                Generally, people suffer stress, depression and anxiety. They lose faith in computer systems and some
                even stop using internet banking and limit their interactions with only close and trusted family
                members.
