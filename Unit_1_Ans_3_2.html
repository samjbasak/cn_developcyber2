            HOME USER - impact would be limited to home user.
            At the most, only his details are compromised and his losses may be his life savings.
            It may be that his identity is stolen and his whole life gets ruined.
            He will spend enormous amount of time pleading with banks that he was the subject of fraud.
            If he cannot prove it then he has to suffer the losses.
            His mental health will get impacted and so will his relationships, if he is not a strong minded person.
            <p></p>
            BUSINESS -The entire computer systems of the business will be affected.
            The customer data on its system will be compromised and it will be hundres or thousands of customer victims
            of the hacker.
            The lose will be for the business in loss of reputation, downward share price, customers leaving and claims
            for compensation.
            It will need to invest in employee "Safe Use" exercises and put right the damage caused to the computer
            system.
            The time, money and cost involved is enormous when the company has to identify breaches, restore and recover
            data and put right the damage.
            The outage of the computer system is an addition cost in terms of lost revenue.

            <li class="listindent1"> VIRUSES and MALWARE. </li>
            HOME USER - Only his PC or laptop gets impacted.
            The ransom demands on the Home User are not as much as a company
            The loss is on his personal data and any financial losses.
            The loss is limited to the home user and he will loose his data and sensitive information help on his
            laptop.
            He may be the subject of Blackmail.
            Rogue programs that infected his equipment will may activate camera and video with voice. So his privacy is
            compromised.
            As a result, he may be subject to blackmail.
            <p></p>
            BUSINESS - The company network is more prone to wider damage due to Phishing, Spam and other Malware
            attacks, including DDos attacks.
            The ransome demands are very high because the perceivement is that the company can afford it.
            The infected computers will infected others across the company network.
            The activation of camera and video with voice may compromise important meetings and company plans.
            Trade secrets can get divulged due to snooping.
            Scammers can impersonate a business, sending fraudulent emails, viruses and malware.
            Home wifi password can be hacked. Usually, a neighbour could hack the wifi password to simply use free wifi
            from the neighbour.
            Others can take advantage and data breaches can result in lost files.
            Impact on business could be that software, system and websites are open to corruption, and even loss of
            assets or intellectual property.
            Scammers can impersonate a business, sending fraudulent emails, virus and malware.

            HOME USER: It will be simply a nuisance and annoyance for the user.
            The impact is very minimal.
            The user can quickly re-boot his computer or disconnect and reconnect.
            The user will generally start to use virus scanner and be careful to dis-infect his computer at no great
            cost.

            BUSINESS - The business suffers from systems outage.
            Time is money. So time lost being off-lines is money lost.
            The business may be faced with ransom demands and it may decide to pay up what it terms as "worth paying",
            just to get back up and running, to stop even greater business losses.
            The comany may suffer negative publicity and perhaps loss of customer base.
            Reputation damage and legal consequences could impact profitablity balance sheet and be reflected in
            negative share price.
