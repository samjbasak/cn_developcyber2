                <p> The impact is minimal as they can have their systems back up and running with little outage.</p>
                <li class="listinden1"> Loss of Data : -</li>
                <p> Companies may suffer financially and increased cost to recover data loss. They can only hope to
                    restore some data but for data corruption they will need to go to great lengths to undo the loss.
                    They will need to reply on their backup and recovery to restore but some data loss may be permanent.
                    </li>
                    <li class="listindent1"> Loss of Reputation and Customers: -</li>
                    <p> If the company suffers hacking but they can keep it hushed then the loss is manageable.
                        In case of the hacking making news, they can lose a lot of business as customer may be tempted
                        to go to competitors.
                    </p>
                    <li class="listindent1"> Downward Drop in Share Price: -</li>
                    <p> The share prices will go into downward spiral for financial companies as customers will never
                        trust their services, investments and personal information being compromised. If the share
                        prices goes down, the company may become a ripe target for a takeover bid.
                        The telephone company TalkTalk, suffered 10% share price drop as a result of hacking and bad
                        publicity.
                        <li class="listindent1"> Company may even go bust, due to the loss suffered and Legal Actions: -
                        </li>
                        <p> It is not uncommon for companies to never recover from losses due to hacking.
                            In such cases, it leaves them no option but to go into administration and the company has to
                            cease trading.
                            If the company gets sued in a court of law and are found guilty of gross negligence in
                            protecting the data and personal information of its customer then the fines may bring about
                            the shutting down.
                            With cost of litigation and court orders, it forces the company to go into loss and
                            administration or closure.
