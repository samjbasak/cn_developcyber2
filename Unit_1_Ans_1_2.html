            <ol>
                <li class="listinden1"> Distributed Denial of Service (DDoD) attack - By an Activist : -</li>
                <p>The “Activist” aims to disrupt or cause temporary outage of systems where the computer system is
                    subjected traffic overload and cause it to crash. Motive is usually to take revenge.</p>
                <li class="listinden1"> Viruses and Malware - By Professional Hackers : -</li>
                <p> Viruses and Malware infect computer systems. They mutate and infect other computers within the
                    network. They can be used to spy on the victim computer, turn on audio and video, inspect the
                    storage of data, steal, corrupt, or delete data. Motive is usually finance gain. </li>
                    <li class="listindent1"> Fraud and Financial Crime - The Insider and by the Professional</li>
                    <p> The Insider possess “the keys to the castle” without the need for a “Trojan horse”.
                        They will often steal financial information or sensitive data including personal information and
                        log-in credentials.
                        The insider is usually a disgruntled employee, a third party supplier who has
                        access to computer systems as part of their support contract.
                        The “Well Intentioned Misguided Person (WIMP)”, who thinks he is simply going
                        out of his way to help the company and does not realize that he has fallen to a
                        scam. The net result is his actions that he unwittingly leaves them and their entire
                        organization open to a possible cyber-attack or data loss incident.
                        The security is compromised, data may be lost, corrupted, deleted and sold on
                        the dark web. Credit Cards details can be used to commit fraud resulting in
                        financial loss.
                        Fraud also involves taking on identity of victims and commiting financial crime in
                        the victim’s name.

                    <li class="listinden1"> Bullying, Blackmail, Randsome and Trolling - The Activist, Insider or
                        Professional : -</li>
                    <p> These invididuals may use personal details of employees as a result of targeted hacking.
                        The Motive is financial gain and revenge. </p>
