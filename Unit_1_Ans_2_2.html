                    <li class="listindent1"> TYPE Of THREAT : EVASEDROPPING. </li>
                    Also known as sniffing or snooping attack, is an incursion where someone tries to steal information 
                    that computers, smartphones, or other devices transmit over a network via intercepting the data sent using wifi 
                    by listening and capturing the transmited data traffic.
                    Usually, there will be a vehical parked outside target premises, close enough to intercept signals.

                    <li class="listindent1"> TYPE Of THREAT : DDoS - DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE.</li>
                    There are scripts written or bots that continually issue rapid requests for service 
                    where the computer systems is not designed to handle vast volumes of data data requests simultaneously 
                    or within a short period of time. 
                    The virtual memory cache gets used up and causes the system to crash or the network infrastructure is not capable to handle such volumes of data requests
                    and this way, they bring down the normal operation of a computer system.
                    The infrastructure is not designed to handle the traffic and grinds to halt, causing a system outage.

                    <li class="listindent1"> TYPE Of THREAT : VIRUSES and CROSS PLATFORM MALWARE.</li>
                    Careless clicking on links or download of documents of “so-called FREE software”, 
                    this is their opportunity to deploy Maleware when you unzip or unpack java jar files onto your computer system.
                    The downloads contain specialised payloads and components, designed to infect your computer system. 
                    They can monitor files and incoming and outgoing data transmission and even view the camera and mic. 
                    Malware also includes keyloggers for them to see every keystroke typed. 
                    The variant is written in C++ using Qt, a cross-platform application framework that is widely being used for developing applications to run on various software and hardware platforms.

                    <li class="listindent1"> TYPE Of THREAT : PHISPHING.</li>
                    A type of social engineering used to trick the user where the hacker is masquerading as a trusted entity.
                    The victim ends up opening an email, instant message, or text message. 
                    The victim is tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, 
                    the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.

                    <li class="listindent1"> TYPE Of THREAT : SQL INJECTION.</li>
                    Poorly designed applications are compromised where SQL injection method inserts its own code 
                    designed to make backend database queries and get to the data masking as if it is a genuine database query to return the data, 
                    which then gets used to commit cyber fraud.
